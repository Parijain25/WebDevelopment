    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>I am ANUJ SHARMA from the MCA branch with scholar Id 40.
 I have always been into wires, motherboards, and other hardware
and software’s. I did my graduation the Institute of Management
Studies, Ghaziabad. .</p>
    <p>The primary learning, I could remember from there was, never-giveup. Apart from all the technical know-how, I learnt that working in a
team can make everything successful.
Struggling with career goals and paths, I made my mind to go for
higher studies. MCA was my passion, for it had everything to offer
that could polish my skills. With hard work, I got my dream college,
and now I am here.
